# POOKIE Presale Management Tools

This collection of tools helps you manage your POOKIE token presale by synchronizing Solana blockchain transactions with your Supabase database and providing monitoring and visualization capabilities.

## üéØ Features

- **Transaction Import**: Import recent Solana transactions to your Supabase database
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor treasury wallet balance in real-time
- **Contribution Tracking**: Track individual contributions with details like wallet address
- **Visual Dashboard**: View beautiful ASCII charts and graphs in your console
- **Stats Verification**: Verify that all contributions are properly recorded
- **Database Functions**: SQL functions for presale statistics and data integrity

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Run the final setup script:
   ```bash
   node scripts/setup-final.js
   ```

2. Follow the interactive prompts to:
   - Check/create necessary configuration files
   - Install required dependencies
   - Set up SQL functions in your Supabase project
   - Start using the tools

3. **IMPORTANT**: You must run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard before the scripts will work correctly!

## üìä Available Tools

### 1. Transaction Import

Import recent Solana blockchain transactions to your Supabase database:

```bash
node scripts/import-transactions.js
```

This ensures all contributions are properly recorded and reflected in the presale statistics.

### 2. Treasury Monitoring

Monitor the treasury wallet balance in real-time:

```bash
node scripts/monitor-treasury.js
```

This continuously tracks the wallet balance and updates the database accordingly.

### 3. Stats Verification

Check current contribution statistics and verify database integrity:

```bash
node scripts/check-stats.js
```

This tool helps you validate that all contributions are properly recorded.

### 4. Visual Dashboard

View a beautiful console dashboard with charts and graphs:

```bash
node scripts/visualize-presale.js
```

Get a visual overview of your presale progress, including:
- Progress bar toward target
- Contribution distribution by size
- Timeline of contributions
- Recent activity log

## üîß Database Setup

The `scripts/treasury-functions.sql` file provides essential database setup:

- Creates the `contributions` table if it doesn't exist
- Creates the `presale_stats` view
- Provides functions to update presale statistics from treasury balance
- Enables real-time functionality
- Sets up appropriate permissions

## üìù Requirements

- Node.js v16 or higher
- Supabase project with appropriate permissions
- Properly configured `.env.local` file with:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_WALLET`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL` (optional)

## üåü Advanced Usage

For production environments:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Use PM2 to keep the monitoring script running:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start scripts/monitor-treasury.js --name "treasury-monitor"
   ```

2. **Scheduled Imports**: Set up cron jobs to regularly import new transactions:
   ```bash
   # Example cron job to run every hour
   0 * * * * cd /path/to/project && node scripts/import-transactions.js
   ```

3. **Dashboard Display**: Use a dedicated terminal window with the visualization tool for real-time stats:
   ```bash
   # Run in a dedicated terminal
   watch -n 60 node scripts/visualize-presale.js
   ```

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Make sure you've run the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard
2. Check that your `.env.local` file has the correct credentials
3. Ensure your Supabase anonymous key has the necessary permissions
4. For rate limiting from Solana RPC, consider using a dedicated RPC provider

## üîç Modifications Made

These scripts have been specifically customized to work with your existing database structure. We've:

1. Created a complete table creation script to ensure all necessary fields exist
2. Modified all scripts to work with your table structure
3. Created a setup script that properly configures everything
4. Provided detailed error checking and recovery mechanisms

## üìö Next Steps

After setting up these tools:

1. Run the setup script to configure your environment
2. Execute the SQL script in your Supabase dashboard
3. Start monitoring your treasury and importing transactions
4. Use the visualization tools to track your presale progress
