   - Start using the tools

## üìä Available Tools

### 1. Transaction Import

Import recent Solana blockchain transactions to your Supabase database:

```bash
node scripts/import-transactions.js
```

This ensures all contributions are properly recorded and reflected in the presale statistics.

### 2. Treasury Monitoring

Monitor the treasury wallet balance in real-time:

```bash
node scripts/monitor-treasury.js
```

This continuously tracks the wallet balance and updates the database accordingly.

### 3. Stats Verification

Check current contribution statistics and verify database integrity:

```bash
node scripts/check-stats.js
```

This tool helps you validate that all contributions are properly recorded.

### 4. Visual Dashboard

View a beautiful console dashboard with charts and graphs:

```bash
node scripts/visualize-presale.js
```

Get a visual overview of your presale progress, including:
- Progress bar toward target
- Contribution distribution by tier
- Timeline of contributions
- Recent activity log

## üîß SQL Functions

The `scripts/treasury-functions.sql` file provides essential database functions:

- Creation of the `presale_stats` view
- Functions to update presale statistics from treasury balance
- Functions to retrieve contribution stats
- Real-time functionality setup

## üìù Requirements

- Node.js v16 or higher
- Supabase project with appropriate permissions
- Properly configured `.env.local` file with:
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_TREASURY_WALLET`
  - `SOLANA_RPC_URL` (optional)

## üåü Advanced Usage

For production environments:

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: Use PM2 to keep the monitoring script running:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start scripts/monitor-treasury.js --name "treasury-monitor"
   ```

2. **Scheduled Imports**: Set up cron jobs to regularly import new transactions:
   ```bash
   # Example cron job to run every hour
   0 * * * * cd /path/to/project && node scripts/import-transactions.js
   ```

3. **Dashboard Display**: Use a dedicated terminal window with the visualization tool for real-time stats:
   ```bash
   # Run in a dedicated terminal
   watch -n 60 node scripts/visualize-presale.js
   ```

## üìö For More Information

Detailed documentation for each script is available in the `scripts/README.md` file.

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check that your `.env.local` file has the correct credentials
2. Verify that the SQL functions are properly installed in Supabase
3. Ensure your Supabase anonymous key has the necessary permissions
4. For rate limiting from Solana RPC, consider using a dedicated RPC provider
